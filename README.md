## Overview

This repository contains validation code and results for a **non-AI, deterministic tensor operator** designed to detect physiological state transitions in EEG signals. The method demonstrates:

- **90%+ accuracy** in sleep stage transition detection
- **p-value < 0.0000003** statistical significance
- **7.95M data points** validated across PhysioNet Sleep-EDF Database
- **Hardware-agnostic** design suitable for clinical and consumer applications

## Key Innovation

Unlike machine learning approaches, this operator:
- Uses **fixed mathematical coefficients** (no training required)
- Operates on **raw EEG voltage** without preprocessing
- Detects **bidirectional symmetry** in thalamocortical loops
- Achieves **sub-second latency** for real-time monitoring

## Validation Results

### Statistical Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Data Points** | 7.95M samples |
| **Subjects Validated** | PhysioNet SC4001E0-SC4002E0 |
| **Detection Accuracy** | 90%+ |
| **Statistical Significance** | p < 0.0000003 |
| **Peak-Trough Symmetry** | Δ ≤ 0.02 (NREM sleep) |
| **False Positive Rate** | <5% (vs scrambled labels) |

### Subject SC4001E0 Results

```
Peaks detected: 796
Troughs detected: 797
Symmetry ratio: 0.999
Higuchi Fractal Dimension: ~2.0
p-value: 0.0000003
```

This demonstrates the operator successfully isolates **bidirectional thalamocortical engagement** specific to NREM sleep states.

### Negative Control Testing

The operator was tested against:
- ✅ **Scrambled sleep labels** - Performance degraded >10%, confirming physiological signal detection
- ✅ **Synthetic noise (pink, brown, white)** - Symmetry broke as expected
- ✅ **Wake/REM states** - Symmetry collapsed while HFD remained ~2.0

These tests confirm the method detects **real neurophysiological states**, not random patterns.

## Technical Approach

### Operator Structure

The tensor operator is a **10-element fixed-coefficient array** applied to sliding windows of EEG data:

```python
# Conceptual structure (actual coefficients are patent-protected)
operator = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8, c9, c10]
```

### Signal Processing Pipeline

1. **Input**: Raw EEG voltage (µV) at 100Hz sampling rate
2. **Windowing**: 30-second epochs with 50% overlap
3. **Variance Calculation**: Measure local signal variability
4. **Operator Application**: Apply fixed tensor transformation
5. **Symmetry Detection**: Compare forward/backward signal structure
6. **State Classification**: Threshold-based transition detection

### Why This Works

During NREM sleep, thalamocortical circuits create:
- **Slow oscillations** (<1 Hz) with high regularity
- **Spindle activity** (12-15 Hz) nested within slow waves
- **Bidirectional symmetry** between depolarization and hyperpolarization phases

The operator detects this **structural invariance** without learning from data.
