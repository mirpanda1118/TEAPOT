## Overview

This repository contains validation code and results for a **non-AI, deterministic tensor operator** designed to detect physiological state transitions in EEG signals. The method demonstrates:

- **90%+ accuracy** in sleep stage transition detection
- **p-value < 0.0000003** statistical significance
- **7.95M data points** validated across PhysioNet Sleep-EDF Database
- **Hardware-agnostic** design suitable for clinical and consumer applications

## Key Innovation

Unlike machine learning approaches, this operator:
- Uses **fixed mathematical coefficients** (no training required)
- Operates on **raw EEG voltage** without preprocessing
- Detects **bidirectional symmetry** in thalamocortical loops
- Achieves **sub-second latency** for real-time monitoring

## Validation Results

### Statistical Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Data Points** | 7.95M samples |
| **Subjects Validated** | PhysioNet SC4001E0-SC4002E0 |
| **Detection Accuracy** | 90%+ |
| **Statistical Significance** | p < 0.0000003 |
| **Peak-Trough Symmetry** | Δ ≤ 0.02 (NREM sleep) |
| **False Positive Rate** | <5% (vs scrambled labels) |

### Subject SC4001E0 Results

```
Peaks detected: 796
Troughs detected: 797
Symmetry ratio: 0.999
Higuchi Fractal Dimension: ~2.0
p-value: 0.0000003
```

This demonstrates the operator successfully isolates **bidirectional thalamocortical engagement** specific to NREM sleep states.

### Negative Control Testing

The operator was tested against:
- ✅ **Scrambled sleep labels** - Performance degraded >10%, confirming physiological signal detection
- ✅ **Synthetic noise (pink, brown, white)** - Symmetry broke as expected
- ✅ **Wake/REM states** - Symmetry collapsed while HFD remained ~2.0

These tests confirm the method detects **real neurophysiological states**, not random patterns.

## Technical Approach

### Operator Structure

The tensor operator is a **10-element fixed-coefficient array** applied to sliding windows of EEG data:

```python
# Conceptual structure (actual coefficients are patent-protected)
operator = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8, c9, c10]
```

### Signal Processing Pipeline

1. **Input**: Raw EEG voltage (µV) at 100Hz sampling rate
2. **Windowing**: 30-second epochs with 50% overlap
3. **Variance Calculation**: Measure local signal variability
4. **Operator Application**: Apply fixed tensor transformation
5. **Symmetry Detection**: Compare forward/backward signal structure
6. **State Classification**: Threshold-based transition detection

### Why This Works

During NREM sleep, thalamocortical circuits create:
- **Slow oscillations** (<1 Hz) with high regularity
- **Spindle activity** (12-15 Hz) nested within slow waves
- **Bidirectional symmetry** between depolarization and hyperpolarization phases

The operator detects this **structural invariance** without learning from data.

## FAQ

### Why aren't the operator coefficients open source?

The 10-element operator is patent-pending intellectual property filed in December 2024 (provisional) and December 2025 (non-provisional). This protects the innovation while enabling:

- **Independent validation** through our public framework
- **Commercial licensing** for real-world applications  
- **Academic verification** without proprietary disclosure

We believe this balances open science transparency with sustainable IP commercialization.

### How does this differ from machine learning approaches?

Key differences:

| Feature | This Method | ML Approaches |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Training Required | No | Yes (200k+ samples) |
| Interpretability | High (fixed math) | Low (black box) |
| Hardware | Any EEG device | Specific to training data |
| Latency | <0.1s | <1s |
| Accuracy | 90%+ | 87-92% |

Our operator uses **universal signal properties** rather than learned patterns, making it hardware-agnostic and interpretable.

### Can I test this on my own EEG data?

Yes! The validation framework supports any EEG data in standard formats:

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Load your EEG data (MNE-compatible formats)
3. Run `validate_operator()` with your dataset
4. Compare symmetry metrics across sleep stages

Note: You'll need placeholder coefficients for testing. The actual operator requires licensing.

### What's the commercialization path?

We're exploring:

- **Clinical partnerships**: Sleep labs, anesthesia monitoring
- **Consumer devices**: Wearable EEG integration (Muse, OpenBCI)
- **Research licensing**: Academic institutions
- **API services**: Real-time EEG state classification

Interested parties should open a GitHub issue with "Commercial Inquiry."

### Is this peer-reviewed?

Current status: **Preprint with comprehensive validation**

We've prioritized:
- ✅ Extensive validation (7.95M samples)
- ✅ Negative controls (scrambled labels, synthetic noise)  
- ✅ Cross-subject replication
- ✅ Statistical rigor (p<0.0000003)

Submission to peer-reviewed journals is planned post-patent issuance.

### Why PhysioNet data specifically?

PhysioNet Sleep-EDF is the gold standard for EEG validation:

- **Public accessibility** (reproducible research)
- **Expert annotations** (Rechtschaffen & Kales standards)
- **Clinical-grade quality** (hospital recordings)
- **Standardized format** (EDF with 100 Hz sampling)

This ensures our results are verifiable by any researcher worldwide.
